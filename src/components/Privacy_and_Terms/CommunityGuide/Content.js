                    <p className="text-[#afafaf] mb-[18px] text-[17px]">We believe that everyone should have access to free language
                        education. Our guidelines are meant to build a mutual understanding
                        of what being a part of this community is all about. We will take
                        action if any of these guidelines are not upheld, so please read carefully.

                    <h4 className="text-[#3c3c3c] text-[18px] mb-[10px] font-bold">Always be Respectful</h4>
                    <p className="text-[#afafaf] mb-[18px] text-[17px]">We come together from across the world at varying language levels with the same
                        goal in mind - to learn. Curiosity, questioning, and cultural understanding are
                        something we celebrate. Be respectful of others and where they’re coming from.

                    <h4 className="text-[#3c3c3c] text-[18px] mb-[10px] font-bold">Help and support across all skill levels</h4>
                    <p className="text-[#afafaf] mb-[18px] text-[17px]">We are all in this together. Learning a language is hard and takes a lot of courage
                        and dedication. If someone uses incorrect grammar or has a question you think has an
                        obvious answer, kindly and calmly help them out. Heckling and being straight up mean
                        doesn’t help anyone learn. Can’t say it nicely? Don’t weigh in.
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="text-[#3c3c3c] text-[18px] mb-[10px] font-bold">Embrace and share regional language differences</h4>
                    <p className="text-[#afafaf] mb-[18px] text-[17px]">A language can have many words, accents and ways to say the same thing. We think that’s
                        one of the wonders of languages. Approach these conversations with an open mind and attitude.
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="text-[#3c3c3c] text-[18px] mb-[10px] font-bold">Think before you share</h4>
                    <p className="text-[#afafaf] mb-[18px] text-[17px]">We care about your safety. Speaking another language is inherently social, but please beware
                        of swapping or posting any private information that could be misused. That includes your phone number,
                        age, address, what time you’ll be at home, school name, email, or other personal information that could
                        put your privacy at risk. Simply put: don’t over-share. Sharing and encouraging others to share personal
                        data might get your post, and possibly your account, removed.

                    <p className="text-[#afafaf] mb-[18px] text-[17px]">Duolingo is a safe place for learners of all backgrounds. Harassment
                        and hurtful content will not be tolerated. Using symbols, names and
                        text that promote hate—as well as harassing, stalking, impersonating,
                        and making sexual remarks towards someone—are considered abuse. The same
                        goes for nudity and disturbing profile pictures and usernames. As stated in
                        the <a className="text-[#0000EE]" href="#/terms">terms</a> , Duolingo reserves the right to replace images or remove these accounts
                        at its sole discretion. Rule of thumb: if you are making someone feel attacked or
                        hurt, then you shouldn’t be doing it. We take these reports seriously and may delete
                        your account without previous notice if such activity is verified by our team.

                        on Duolingo may get your account deleted. This includes not only creating posts without substance,
                        but any type of spamming.
                        It's okay to share external resources and links. But just like with copyrighted and pirated materials,
                        you should know that spamming, referral code hocking, advertising, and excessively promoting products/services
                        is not acceptable and such posts and references can be removed without warning.

                        negative or significant manner, your account and posts may be removed.

                    <p className="text-[#afafaf] mb-[18px] text-[17px]">Hateful, obscene and off-topic comments don’t contribute to learning. Cursing doesn’t either (let people discover those words in the wild).
                        Leave them out of the language discussions.
